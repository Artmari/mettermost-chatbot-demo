# A ChatGPT-powered Chatbot for Mattermost

There's a nice detailed guide about how to do all of the steps below written by @InterestingSoup, [here: Create a ChatGPT bot on Mattermost](https://interestingsoup.com/create-a-chatgpt-bot-on-mattermost/)

Here's the short version - it's easy if you have a Docker container.
You need
 - the [Mattermost token](https://docs.mattermost.com/integrations/cloud-bot-accounts.html) for the bot user `@chatgpt`
 - the [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
 - a Docker container for continuously running the service

First step is to clone this repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/yGuy/chatgpt-mattermost-bot.git && cd chatgpt-mattermost-bot
```

For testing, you could now just run `npm install` and `npm run start` or `node src/botservice.js` directly, but be sure to set the below environment variables or pass them to the node process, first!

For production use, in order to create a service on a docker container that will always provide the service without you having to run it on your own PC, you can do the following:

Create the docker image
```
docker build . -t yguy/chatgpt-mattermost-bot
```

Run Docker service
```
docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \
  -e MATTERMOST_URL=https://mattermost.server \
  -e MATTERMOST_TOKEN=abababacdcdcd \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=234234234234234234 \
  --name chatbot \
  yguy/chatgpt-mattermost-bot
```

With a custom certificate stored in `/absolutepath/to/certfile.crtÂ´ for your mattermost instance (if required for locally hosted mattermost instances on https) you can do it like so
```
docker run -d --restart unless-stopped \
  -v /absolutepath/to/certfile.crt:/certs/certfile.crt \
  -e NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=/certs/certfile.crt \
  -e MATTERMOST_URL=https://mattermost.server \
  -e MATTERMOST_TOKEN=abababacdcdcd \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=234234234234234234 \
  --name chatbot \
  yguy/chatgpt-mattermost-bot
```

Verify it's running
```
docker ps
```

Later, to stop the service
```
docker stop chatbot
```

Here's an example chat that I just had with our bot:

>@yguy:
>@chatgpt - please write a short introductory paragraph for the README in the GitHub repo that hosts the sources for you, the friendly Mattermost bot. Tell the readers that you enjoy working for the nice people at yWorks and that everybody should install a Mattermost chatbot into their Mattermost chat system to benefit from a nice and helpful assistant like you are. I will include this in the README on the GitHub repo, so make this an engaging text! Thanks!
